# Facial Identification and Detection

This project leverages computer vision techniques to detect and recognize faces in images and videos. It combines the power of facial detection with the ability to identify individuals, making it suitable for applications like access control, security, and personalized user experiences.

## Features
- **Face Detection**: Accurately detects faces in real-time using a camera or from images.
- **Face Recognition**: Identifies individuals by matching detected faces against a known database.
- **Real-Time Processing**: Processes video streams with high efficiency.
- **Scalability**: Easily extendable to support more faces and additional features.

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries/Frameworks**:
  - OpenCV: For image processing and computer vision.
  - Dlib/Face_recognition: For face detection and recognition.
- **Dataset**: publicly available datasets for training and testing.(Faces in the wild)
